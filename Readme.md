                  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)


The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data are derived from a the Center for Desease Control and Prevenstion (CDC) coordinating with administrative bodies (typically states). This data includes health information, demographic and lifestyle as reported by the study participants (summarized from https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

These specific data were collected for the year 2013. The data were collected by phone (landline and cellular) surveys from a random sample of the populations within the administrative districts (states). The size is about 400,000.

Because the participants were selected at random inferences of anayses performed should be generizable, but as there were no experiments performed, they are NOT suitable to determine causation.
